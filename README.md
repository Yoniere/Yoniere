I graduated with a degree in B.Sc. in Industrial Engineering and Management specializing in Information Systems in 2016. From 2017 till 2022 I have been working at LG Electronics as a Retail Product Manager. During this time, I was awarded for 2 consecutive years 2019 - Best Employee of the Year for significant increase of revenue and profit, 2020 Middle East & Africa Employee of the Year for achieving sales target of strategic product. By the end of 2021 I decided to take a big step and change my current field to my real passion - development. At the beginning of 2022 my new career journey began and I joint a 4 months Web Development bootcamp program at Coding Academy. I am proud to introduce my final project with 2 other teammates:

So, here I am looking for my next challenge as Fullstack | Frontend | Web developer rule.

About me, I consider myself as either team player and individual. I am a self learner and highly motivated, love facing challenges and enriching my knowledge. What I love the best in development is the satisfaction of solving a problem after facing it for some time.

My specialties include responsive design principles, single page applications, Model View Controller (MVC) methods of organizing code. So far I have Vue.js, Vuex, React.js, Redux Frameworks and APIs and REST with Node.js, MongoDB, JavaScript(ES6), TypeScript, HTML5, CSS3, SASS, jQuery, Bootstrap, Git/GitHub under my belt.
